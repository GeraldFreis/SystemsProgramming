 ONE  day  when Pooh Bear had nothing else to do, he thought
he would do something, so he went round to  Piglet's  house  to
see  what  Piglet was doing. It was still snowing as he stumped
over the white forest track, and he  expected  to  find  Piglet
warming  his  toes in front of his fire, but to his surprise he
saw that the door was open, and the more he looked  inside  the
more Piglet wasn't there.
        "He's  out,"  said Pooh sadly. "That's what it is. He's
not in. I shall have to go a  fast  Thinking  Walk  by  myself.
Bother!"
        But  first  he  thought that he would knock very loudly
just to make quite sure . . . and while he  waited  for  Piglet
not  to  answer,  he jumped up and down to keep warm, and a hum
came suddenly into his head, which seemed to him  a  Good  Hum,
such as is Hummed Hopefully to Others.
